# Combinations

This directory contains the code to combine calibration from the Cosmic and Source origins into one calibration constant.

## Concept

Both Cosmics and Source calibrations will take place independently. Source has access to 6.13MeV photons, Cosmics uses 20MeV cosmics.

We can compare the two constants to understand how things change with energy.

## Development

Currently being developed by Sam Zhou and Sophie Middleton
